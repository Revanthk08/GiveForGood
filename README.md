## About
A team of 4 students at Veltech University developed a food donation application to tackle food wastage and hunger in our locality. The app provides users with a simple and convenient way to donate surplus food to nearby charities and community organizations, and track the impact of their donations.

Our team employed the use of Flutter, Dart, and Firebase to develop the application's authentication features. Flutter aided us in creating an intuitive and seamless user interface, while Dart provided a dependable programming language. Firebase's authentication feature enabled us to manage user data in a secure and private manner.
 We are proud of our achievements and remain committed to developing innovative solutions to address critical social problems.
